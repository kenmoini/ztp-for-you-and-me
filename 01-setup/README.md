# Configuration & Setup

Before you can begin there needs to be a few things done to the Hub cluster, and we'll need to deploy a few things.

1. [Hub Cluster One-Time Dependant Configuration](./hub-setup.md) - Things to do on the Hub SNO/Cluster before installing things.
2. [Operator Installation](./operator-installation.md) - Operators to install on the Hub SNO/Cluster
3. [Configure Services](./configure-services.md) - Enable ACM services, optionally configure for disconnected/proxy environments
